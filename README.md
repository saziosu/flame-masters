# Site Goals
The goals of the site are to provide users with an attractive site providing a range of Hot Sauces and Spicy Snacks with varying levels of heat.
The user can decide how hot they want to go and view all products within that range.
If the user has a favourite brand, they can also view all products from that range.


# Agile Methodology
This project was developed using agile methodologies by utilising Epics and User stories.
User storied were assigned to Epics. 
The Epics & User Stories were prioritised by labels. `must have`, `should have`, `could have`.
A kanban board in GitHub was used to track these, with a `not started`, `in progress`, `done`, `NINTH(not important, nice to have)` and `bug` sections.
When a user story is completed, it gets moved to the done section.
The full kanban board can be viewed here: LINK

## Labels
The labels are priorised as follows:

|             |                                                                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| must have   | This feature/issue is required for the project to function                           |
| should have | Important to implement but will not crash the project without but still key features |
| could have  | would like to have, but not essential to the project                                 |
| bug         | Something isn't working                                                              |

These result in the following stats:
