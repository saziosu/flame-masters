# Agile Methodology
This project was developed using agile methodologies by utilising Epics and User stories.
User storied were assigned to Epics. 
The Epics & User Stories were prioritised by labels. `must have`, `should have`, `could have`.
A kanban board in GitHub was used to track these, with a `not started`, `in progress`, `done`, `NINTH(not important, nice to have)` and `bug` sections.
When a user story is completed, it gets moved to the done section.
The full kanban board can be viewed here: LINK

## Labels
The labels are priorised as follows:

must have|This feature/issue is required for the project to function
should have|Important to implement but will not crash the project without but still key features
could have|Would like to have

These result in the following stats:

## Epics
There are three Epics within this project:

**EPIC: ONEt**
Details on epic one

**EPIC: TWO**
Details on Epic two


## User Stories
Majority of User stories are linked to Epics. Labels are applied for prioritisation, such as `must have`, `should have` and `could have`.
