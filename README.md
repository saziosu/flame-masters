# Site Goals
The goals of the site are to provide users with an attractive site providing a range of Hot Sauces and Spicy Snacks with varying levels of heat.
The user can decide how hot they want to go and view all products within that range.
If the user has a favourite brand, they can also view all products from that range.

# Business Model

## Business Overview:
Our business operates as a B2C e-commerce platform, dedicated to providing a diverse range of fiery hot sauces and spicy snacks through an online store. It specializes in offering affordable yet flavorful products, catering to spice enthusiasts with pricing ranging from $1.95 to $17.95.

* The business may also benefit from partnering with influencers, the size of which depends on the size of the business to coincide with demand.

# SEO

[Wordtracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/search?query=hot%20sauce) was used to help generate keywords on the site.
Description and meta tags were used to help the SEO. Although Google does not use meta keywords for searches anymore these were added for the short tail keywords for consistency.

## Keywords

* Short tail keywords: hot sauce, spicy snacks, spicy food, chili sauce, spicy noodles, spicy nuts, habanero, jalapeno, ghost pepper, spicy condiments, worldwide, delivery, affordable hot sauces, hot ones hot sauce, da bomb hot sauce

## Sitemap.xml
A sitemap was generated via https://www.mysitemapgenerator.com/ so that search engines like Google can search it effectively

### Robots.txt
I generated a robots.txt file so that google can crawl the site effectively.
The accounts and cart pages were blocked off from User Agent crawling to prevent these pages from being indexed as these wouldn't be necessary to find on a search engine result

### Facebook Business Page

[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61556519101346) was used to generate the Facebook page.
The cover photo uses the same image as the homepage on the site for consistency.
The profile picture was generated using the ChatGPT image generator.

In case this is deactivated, these screenshots are also available:
![Facebook1](readme-images/facebook-1.png)
![Facebook2](readme-images/facebook-2.png)

### Favicon

The favicon for the site was generated using this website:
https://favicon.io/
I used the simple text to ico option, and added it as FM for the initials of the website.

# Database

# Agile Methodology
This project was developed using agile methodologies by utilising Epics and User stories.
User storied were assigned to Epics. 
The Epics & User Stories were prioritised by labels. `must have`, `should have`, `could have`.
A kanban board in GitHub was used to track these, with a `not started`, `in progress`, `done`, `NINTH(not important, nice to have)` and `bug` sections.
When a user story is completed, it gets moved to the done section.
The full kanban board can be viewed here: LINK

## Labels
The labels are priorised as follows:

|             |                                                                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| must have   | This feature/issue is required for the project to function                           |
| should have | Important to implement but will not crash the project without but still key features |
| could have  | would like to have, but not essential to the project                                 |
| bug         | Something isn't working                                                              |

These result in the following stats:

## Wireframes

The following wireframes were used to plan the look of the site:

Home Page:
![homepage wireframe](readme-images/homepage-wireframe.png)

Products Page:
![products wireframe](readme-images/products-wireframe.png)

Cart Page:
![cart wireframe](readme-images/cart-wireframe.png)

# Design

## Color Scheme

The main color scheme is white, grey and black.
This overall gives a pleasant, clean look to the website

## Typography

Fonts were chosen from GoogleFonts

* [Syne](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Syne) was used for header fonts
* [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) was used for all other fonts
* San-serif was used as the fallback font

## Imagery

Images were sourced from several places to get suitable images of a wide range of products.
The full details of sources are in the media credits section of this README

# Features 

## Current Features

### Navigation
![navigation](readme-images/navigation.png)
The navbar is based on the Boutique Ado walkthrough. It is responsive via the bootstrap classes and features options like filtering products, contacting the website admins, viewing the shopping cart and signing up/logging in.

### Authentication
![register](readme-images/register.png)
The authentication is located in the top header navbar section.
This allows users to register for an account, login and sign out.
This allows users to see different content based on their account role like user, or admin/superuser

### Products
![products](readme-images/all-products.png)
The products page is based on the Boutique Ado walkthrough.
It is also responsive via the bootstrap classes and features counts of the products features.
It also allows sorting by brand name, heat level, price, etc.

#### Product Detail
![product detail](readme-images/product-detail.png)
The product detail allows the user to view the full details of the product.
The user can add the product to the cart from this page.
It also includes the average rating and ingredients.
If the website owner marks the product as a staff favourite it also notes this for the user on this page.

### Product Reviews
![product reviews](readme-images/product-review.png)
The product reviews can be found at the bottom of the product detail page.
This allows users to add review if they have ordered a product.
They can also only leave one review for a product, this helps prevent the data on the rating from getting skewed by multiple reviews from one person.
The user that made the review is allowed to edit or delete their review, allowing them to change their feedback.

### Cart & Checkout
![cart](readme-images/cart.png)
The shopping cart uses bootstrap to remain responsive.
It also allows the user to increase or decrease the number of items in the cart via the buttons on the right.

![checkout](readme-images/checkout.png)
The checkout also uses bootstrap to remain responsive.
It provides on order summary and allows the user to save the details added to the checkout to their profile if they are logged in.

### User Profile
![profile](readme-images/profile.png)
The user profile allows the user to update their information that will be loaded into the checkout.
The user can also view their previous orders via the profile page.

### Contact
![contact](readme-images/contact.png)
The contact page allows users to get into contact with the website owners. They can submit general queries, complaints and returns on this page.
This page also allows the user to sign up for the MailChimp newletter to keep up to date with the latest news.

### Contact Submissons
![contact submissions](readme-images/contact-submissions.png)
Superusers can view the contact submissions page, which shows the details of the contact form submissions.
This allows the superusers to view the contacts from their users and provides them with their email address so they can liase with them further.

### User permissions
![user permissions](readme-images/user-perms.png)
The website allows front end CRUD operations for the superuser.
They can add, edit and delete products.
A user that leaves a review is also allowed to add, edit and delete product reviews for products they have purchased.
The restrictions added via the code ensures that there is a secure check placed on each crud operation to ensure only the correct user is allowed to complete these actions.


## Future Features

* Wishlist: It would be nice to have a wishlist to allow users to have more interations with the site. The wishlist is also great for the owners of the site as it allows them to show which products their users love and can then use that information to gear their marketing towards that further.
* Multiple payment options: This site currently uses stripe payments, it would be nice in future to add options to include applepay and google pay to allow for swifter checkouts.
* Live Chat Support: As the website grows, it would be great to include a live chat support for users to speak directly with a member of staff for any questions or concerns they may have.

## Accessibility

* Aria Labels were used on all buttons and links throughout the site to ensure accessibility needs are met
* On the initial completion of the code, I used lighthouse to look into accessibility of the site. There were several issues noted with the links and colors on the site. The links for CRUD functions like updating product quantity, editing product reviews etc were showing issues with color contrast. I updated these to buttons to ensure there was enough contrast for the user.
