# Testing Tools

## W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML code across all pages of the website.
Due to the django templating, pasting directly from the code was not possible.
Instead the source code via the browser was used to test these and directly input into the validator.

TABLE OF TESTING

## CSS Validator

[Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate the CSS code across all possible pages of the website.

TABLE OF TESTING

All other pages required login which was not handled by the validator via the url
Most of the pages are utilising Bootstrap for styling, however the custom css from style.css was input manually and passed with no errors:
